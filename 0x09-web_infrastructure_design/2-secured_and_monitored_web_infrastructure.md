### Description:
- **www.foobar.com**: The domain name for the website.
- **Load Balancer**: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers for load balancing and high availability.
- **SSL Termination**: Terminates SSL encryption and decrypts incoming HTTPS traffic before passing it to the servers.
- **Web Server (Nginx)**: Serves static and dynamic content, handles HTTP requests, and communicates with the application server.
- **Application Server**: Hosts the application logic, handles dynamic content generation, and communicates with the database server.
- **Database Server**: Stores and manages website data using MySQL.
- **Firewall**: Controls and filters incoming and outgoing traffic to ensure network security.
- **Monitoring Client**: Collects and sends performance data to the monitoring system for analysis and alerting.

This infrastructure is designed to provide security through firewalls, encrypt traffic using SSL, and monitor the performance of servers and services to ensure availability and reliability.
