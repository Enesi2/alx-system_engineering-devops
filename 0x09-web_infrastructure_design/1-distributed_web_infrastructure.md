### Server Configuration:
1. **Server 1 (Web Server)**:
   - **Role**: Hosts the Nginx web server to serve static content and act as the primary application server.
  
2. **Server 2 (Application Server)**:
   - **Role**: Acts as a secondary application server to handle additional application logic and dynamic content.

3. **Server 3 (Database Server)**:
   - **Role**: Hosts the MySQL database to store and manage website data.

### Additional Elements and Explanation:
1. **Load Balancer (HAProxy)**:
   - **Reason for Adding**: Introduces load balancing to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers for improved performance and reliability.
   - **Distribution Algorithm**: Round Robin, where each new connection is routed to the next server in line, ensuring even distribution of traffic.
   - **Active-Active vs. Active-Passive Setup**:
     - **Active-Active**: Both servers are actively serving traffic, distributing the load evenly between them.
     - **Active-Passive**: One server serves as the active node, handling all incoming traffic, while the other remains on standby, only becoming active if the primary server fails.

2. **Database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) Cluster**:
   - **Reason for Adding**: Implements replication for data redundancy and fault tolerance.
   - **How it Works**: The primary (master) node handles write operations and replicates data changes to the replica (slave) node(s), which can serve read requests.
   
### Issues with the Infrastructure:
1. **Single Points of Failure (SPOF)**:
   - The web server and application server may still pose SPOFs if they encounter hardware or software failures.
   
2. **Security Issues**:
   - Lack of firewall: Leaves the infrastructure vulnerable to unauthorized access or attacks.
   - No HTTPS: Data transmitted between clients and servers is not encrypted, risking interception or tampering.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Absence of monitoring tools makes it challenging to detect and respond to performance issues, downtime, or security breaches in real-time.

Overall, while this infrastructure improves redundancy, scalability, and performance compared to a single-server setup, it still has some vulnerabilities and lacks essential security and monitoring features. Additional measures such as implementing firewalls, enabling HTTPS, and setting up monitoring tools would enhance its reliability and security.
