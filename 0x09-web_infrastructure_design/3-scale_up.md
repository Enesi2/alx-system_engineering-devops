To scale up the infrastructure, we need to introduce more servers and split components to distribute the workload and improve performance. Here's how we can do it:

1. **Addition of a New Server:**
   - We add a new server to handle increased traffic and workload. This server will host some of the components of our infrastructure.

2. **Load Balancer Configuration:**
   - The existing HAproxy load balancer is configured as a cluster with the new one. This ensures high availability and distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers, improving reliability and performance.

3. **Component Splitting:**
   - Each component (web server, application server, and database) is allocated its own server. This separation allows for better resource management, scalability, and isolation of services.

Explanation of Specifics:

- **Additional Server**: Adding a new server allows us to horizontally scale our infrastructure, accommodating more users and handling increased traffic without overloading existing resources.

- **Clustered Load Balancer**: Clustering the HAproxy load balancers ensures redundancy and fault tolerance. If one load balancer fails, the other can seamlessly take over, minimizing downtime and maintaining service availability.

- **Component Splitting**: Separating components onto dedicated servers improves performance and security. Each component can be optimized independently, and failures or issues in one component do not affect others, enhancing reliability and scalability
